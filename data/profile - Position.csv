Healthcare Data/Reporting Analyst,"Nice to meet you, we're Vesta Healthcare.

Vesta Healthcare is a startup with a simple mission: Delivering extraordinary outcomes by unlocking the power of caregivers. Caregivers are one of the largest, most untapped resources in the healthcare delivery system and are the unsung heroes of their care recipients. Yet despite their vital role, they are largely unsupported and invisible to the healthcare ecosystem.

At Vesta Healthcare, we enable people with personal assistance to thrive at home, in their community by assuring the people they rely on, their caregivers, have the resources, data, and support they need. We achieve this through a combination of analytics, technology, services, and deep healthcare expertise. Our analytics help identify and target the right people and populations. Our technology creates real-time connectivity and actionable data out of observations. Our services connect to real people who can help when needs arise, and our healthcare expertise helps us understand how we create value for both payers and providers.

Our program monitors in real-time, identifying issues before they become health events, and helping connect those in need with those who can help via technologies such as video, chat, and telephone. Our technology platform includes home-based mobile applications, a clinical dashboard, and data analytics on data not previously available to health professionals. We are disrupting a $109 billion industry and have just closed our latest funding round with a blue-chip list of investors.

We're looking to add to our team of experts who care deeply about our mission.

Our team is passionate, driven, collaborative, intellectually curious, and excited about the opportunity to transform our healthcare system. We're inspired by caregivers and seek to create a platform that recognizes, utilizes and supports the vital role they play. We strive to continuously learn, explore, experiment and achieve results. We are here to improve the quality of life for caregivers and care recipients, allowing them to focus on the important things (like going to the mall with their grandkids)

The ideal teammate would be?€?

A data management/analyst who enjoys working with healthcare data so as to support clinicians, software developers, and senior leadership with the information and self help tools they need to succeed in growing our business. A lively curiosity about health care data and analytical tools is greatly desired.

The ideal teammate would be able to:
Understand the needs and opportunities across our internal and external stakeholders

General Description

CUNY Fellowship in the Behavioral Sciences


The City University of New York (CUNY) - Office of Institutional Research and Assessment (OIRA) announces a one-year fellowship in the behavioral sciences. Behavioral science is the study of how people make decisions and act within a complex world where details and context matter. It draws from decades of research in the social sciences to create a more realistic framework for understanding the way people form intentions and take actions.

Behavioral science has been used across a variety of fields to realign policies, programs, and products with how we really behave, improving outcomes for millions of people worldwide. OIRA is testing the use of lessons from the behavioral sciences at CUNY through a project called the Student Persistence Initiative (SPI), which is funded by the Mayor?€?s Office for Economic Opportunity.

CUNY is the nation's leading urban public university serving more than 275,000 students in 25 colleges and institutions in New York City. CUNY-OIRA conducts research and provides data to improve student success and acts as an incubator for new interventions, providing rigorous evidence to identify the most effective, and taking the best to scale at CUNY. SPI is one of these projects.

Under the supervision of the Director for Institutional Research, the fellow will provide quantitative analytic support and data for the implementation and scaling of a set of behavioral interventions over the course of academic year 2020-21. The fellow will work in collaboration with partner CUNY schools and the SPI Project Manager to develop and implement projects that address barriers to student engagement, retention, and success. Planned projects include scaling multi-year interventions through Blackboard, emails, and text messages.

Responsibilities may include but are not limited to:
Conduct student data extraction and analysis (including, but not limited to, academic records, enrollment data, Blackboard analytics, and student experience survey results)
Analyze the effectiveness of SPI interventions and their impact on retention and persistence (including, but not limited to, graduation rates and transfer rates)
Analyze FAFSA renewal rates of student populations in participating senior colleges and community colleges in FAFSA Renewal campaigns

Extract, clean, and manage data from multiple sources
